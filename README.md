# BCA Java Examination Programs

This repository contains my solutions to the Java programming questions from my BCA examination at Pokhara University. The programs cover a range of topics, including object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## How to Use

To run any of the programs, you'll need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of the JDK [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
.

Once you have the JDK installed, you can navigate to the directory containing the program you want to run and use the javac and java commands to compile and execute the code, respectively. For example, to run the HelloWorld.java program, you would do the following:

```bash
  $ javac HelloWorld.java
  $ java HelloWorld
```
